If we can do that, 2020 will be remembered not as the end of the world, but the beginning of a world that works better for everyone.[51]\\nU.S. Congressional testimony\\nOn December 11, 2018, Sundar Pichai was questioned by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on a range of Google-related issues such as possible political bias on Google\\'s platforms, the company\\'s alleged plans for a \"censored search app\" in China, and its privacy practices.[52] In response, Pichai informed the committee that Google employees cannot influence search results. He also stated that Google users can opt out of having their data collected and that \"there are no current plans for a censored search engine\" in China.[53]\\nIn October 2020, the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation unanimously voted in favor of, and on a bipartisan basis, to subpoena Pichai, along with the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter, to testify before the committee in response to lawmakers\\' concerns over the technology industry\\'s exemption from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1934.[54]Awards and recognition\\nIn 2022, Pichai received the Padma Bhushan from the Government of India, its third-highest civilian award.[55][56] On 3rd Dec 2022, Taranjit Singh Sandhu (India\\'s Ambassador to the US) handed over the Padma Bhushan Award to Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in San Francisco.[57]Personal life\\nPichai is married to Anjali Pichai and has two children.[58] His recreational interests include cricket and football.[59][60]References\\n^ \"Company Overview of Alphabet Inc\".
