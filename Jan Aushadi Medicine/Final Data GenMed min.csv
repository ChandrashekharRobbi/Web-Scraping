2037,Esomeprazole Gastro-Resistance Tablets IP 20mg,10's,10,Gastrointestinal (GIT),646,Esoprazole 20mg Tablet,"Esoprazole 20mg Tablet is used to treat conditions related to excessive stomach acid production, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It reduces the amount of acid produced in the stomach and provides relief from symptoms and promotes healing.
Esoprazole 20mg Tablet can also be used to prevent stomach ulcers caused by certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Take the medicine as per your doctor's prescription. The dose will depend on what you are being treated for, but it is usually the lowest dose for the shortest time that is needed to treat your condition. It is usually taken on an empty stomach, preferably in the morning or at least 1 hour prior to meal. Continue taking the medicine even if your symptoms disappear until the doctor say it is okay to stop. If you are taking this medicine for a long time, your doctor may carry out regular tests to check your levels of magnesium which can fall with this medicine.
Common side effects include headache, constipation or diarrhea, stomach pain, and feeling or being sick. These tend to be mild but talk to your doctor if they bother you or do not go away. The risk of side effects may increase the longer you take this medicine. You may be more likely to have a broken bone if you take it for a long time. It is best to avoid foods that seem to make your symptoms worse, such as rich, spicy, and fatty foods. Cutting down on caffeinated drinks, such as tea, coffee, and cola, as well as alcohol may also help.
This medicine is not suitable for some people. Before taking this medicine, you need to tell your doctor if you have severe liver problems, are taking medicines for HIV, have had an allergic reaction to similar medicines in the past, or have osteoporosis. Alcohol does not interfere with the way Esoprazole 20mg Tablet works. However, drinking alcohol makes your stomach produce more acid than normal. This medicine can make you feel dizzy, sleepy, or affect your vision. If this happens, do not drive, cycle, or use machinery or tools until you feel better. It is not usually recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding.",1440.0

It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and prevent angina (heart-related chest pain). It lowers blood pressure and reduces the heart's workload, which helps prevent heart attacks and strokes.
S Amlodipine Tablet may be prescribed alone or along with other medicines. The dose depends on what you are taking it for and the severity of your condition. You can take it at any time of the day, with or without food, but it is best to take it at about the same time each day. You should take this medicine for as long as it is prescribed for you. Even if you feel well, do not stop this medicine on your own because high blood pressure often has no symptoms. If you stop taking it, your condition may get worse. Keeping yourself active with regular exercise, managing your weight, and eating a healthy diet will also help control your blood pressure.
The most common side effects include headache, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and sleepiness. Consult your doctor if any of these side effects bother you or do not go away. They may be able to suggest ways to prevent or reduce the side effects.
Before taking it, let your doctor know if you have any liver, heart, or kidney problems. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking this medicine.

It helps control the high blood sugar levels in your body after each meal. It is used when other similar medicines along with a restricted diet, are unable to control abnormally high blood sugar levels.
Vogliboz 0.2 Tablet should be taken just before a meal. The dose and how often you need it will be decided by your doctor so that you get the right amount to control your blood sugar levels.

235,Budesonide Nebuliser Suspension (1mg/2ml),2 ml,13.2,Respiratory,752,Budebest Nebuliser Suspension,"Budebest Nebuliser Suspension is used to prevent the symptoms of asthma (wheezing and shortness of breath). It is a steroid and is known as a ""preventer"". You need to have a fast-acting “reliever” as well because this medicine will not stop an asthma attack that has already started.
Your doctor will tell you how often you need to use Budebest Nebuliser Suspension. It is important that you take the lowest dose needed to effectively control your asthma. The effect of this medicine may be noticeable after a few days but will only reach its maximum after a few weeks. This medicine must be used regularly to be effective, so go on taking it even if you do not have any symptoms. No symptoms mean that the medicine is doing its job. If you stop taking it your asthma may get worse. It should not be used to relieve sudden asthma attacks. If an asthma attack occurs, use your quick-relief inhaler ""reliever"". To get the benefit from this medicine you need to make sure you get your inhaler technique right, otherwise, it will not work as well.
The most common side effects are irritation in the throat, difficulty swallowing, and fungal infections in the mouth or throat. If you get these, do not stop taking it but do talk to your doctor. You can help prevent these symptoms by rinsing your mouth and throat with water or brushing your teeth after using your inhaler. There are other rare, side effects that can be serious. Talk to your doctor if you are worried about them. In general, you should be trying to avoid situations that make your asthma worse (your triggers) and try not to smoke.
Before taking Budebest Nebuliser Suspension, you should tell your doctor if you have tuberculosis, any infections in your mouth or lungs, or liver disease. While taking it you may be more at risk of getting infections so stay away from people with colds and flu. If you use Budebest Nebuliser Suspension for a long time it may cause weak bones (osteoporosis) and damage to your eyes (glaucoma or cataracts). You might need tests for bone density and eye pressure. Ask your doctor whether it’s safe to take this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.",2030.0

It relieves the long-term symptoms of asthma and COPD, making breathing easier. It works by inhibiting the release of certain chemical messengers that cause inflammation (swelling) and relaxes the muscles in the airways.
Your doctor will tell you how often you need to use your inhaler. The effect of this medicine may be noticeable after a few days but will only reach its maximum after a few weeks. This medicine must be used regularly to be effective, so go on taking it even if you don't have any symptoms. That means it’s doing its job. If you stop taking it your symptoms may get worse. This medicine should not be used to relieve sudden shortness of breath. If sudden shortness of breath occurs, use your rescue inhaler. To get the benefit from this medicine you need to make sure you get your inhaler technique right, otherwise, it does not work as well.
The most common side effects include headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach discomfort, and respiratory tract infection. If you get there, don’t stop taking it but do talk to your doctor. You can prevent some of these symptoms by rinsing your mouth and throat with water or brushing your teeth after using your inhaler. There are other, rarer side effects which can be serious. Talk to your doctor if you're worried about them.
Before taking it, you should tell your doctor if you have any kidney or liver diseases so that your doctor can prescribe a suitable dose for you. You should also tell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning pregnancy or breastfeeding.",

It helps control the high blood sugar levels in your body after each meal. It is used when other similar medicines along with a restricted diet, are unable to control abnormally high blood sugar levels.
Volibo 0.3 Tablet should be taken just before a meal. The dose and how often you need it will be decided by your doctor so that you get the right amount to control your blood sugar levels. Do not stop taking it suddenly without consulting your doctor. If you do, your blood sugar levels may increase and put you at risk of serious complications like kidney damage and blindness.
This medicine is only part of a treatment program that should also include a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight reduction as advised by your doctor. Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly while taking this medicine.
The most common side effects of Volibo 0.3 Tablet include flatulence (gas), stomach pain, loss of appetite, constipation, and diarrhea. Consult your doctor if any of these side effects bother you or do not go away. This medicine by itself does not cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). However, when used in combination with other diabetes medicines (especially insulin or sulphonylureas), it can lead to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). Such episodes of hypoglycemia will have to be treated by taking plain glucose. Table sugar or common sugar will not help correct low blood sugar levels if you are taking this medicine.
Before taking it, let your doctor know if you have any kidney or liver problems. Do not take this medicine if you have ulceration or inflammation in the bowel (eg. ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease). Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking it. Please tell your doctor about all the other medicines you are taking to make sure you are safe.

The dose and how often should take it may depend on what you are taking it for. Take it for as long as it is prescribed for you. In case you missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. It does not work immediately or prevent the already started breathing trouble, hence always carry your medical inhaler with you for an emergency.
The most common side effects of this medicine include vomiting, headache, nausea, and stomach upset. If these bother you or appear serious, let your doctor know. There may be ways of reducing or preventing them. Generally, it is advised not to consume alcohol or do not smoke while on treatment.

Your doctor should also know about all other medicines you are taking as many of these may make this medicine less effective or change the way it works. Inform your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding before starting the treatment.",

Chloramphenicol 1% Eye Ointment helps to improve your symptoms and cure the underlying infection. Follow your doctor’s instructions precisely for administering this medicine in the eye. It should be used regularly at evenly spaced time intervals as prescribed by your doctor. Do not skip any doses and finish the full course of treatment even if you feel better. Stopping the medicine too early may lead to the infection returning or worsening.
It is effective in killing many types of bacteria. However, it will not work for other types of eye infections (e.g.viral) and therefore, should only be used if prescribed by your doctor. Unnecessary use of any antibiotic can lead to a decrease in its effectiveness in the future.
Commonly seen side effects seen with this medicine include temporary stinging in eyes and blurred vision after administration. Consult your doctor if these side effects persist or if your condition worsens. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers should consult their doctor before using it.

Let your doctor know straight away if you develop any sudden worsening of mood or any thoughts about harming yourself.
Before taking this medicine, you should tell your doctor if you have epilepsy (seizure disorder or fits), diabetes, liver or kidney disease, heart problems, or glaucoma.

If you are also using another eye medicine, wait for at least 10 minutes before using it. Read the leaflet that comes with the medicine for a full guide on how to use the drops and get the most benefit. Do not touch the tip of the dropper or bottle. This may lead to infection. You should use this medicine regularly to get the most benefit and it is best done at the same time(s) each day. If you want to stop using it, consult your doctor first.

The most common side effects are blurred vision, irritation, or pain in the eye, watery eyes, and headache. There are other, less common, side effects affecting other parts of the body, some of which may be serious as Iobet Eye Drop is absorbed into the systemic circulation. Read the leaflet that comes with the medicine and consult your doctor if you are bothered by any side effects.

You should not use this medicine if you have asthma, severe COPD, or a serious heart condition. Inform your doctor if you have, or have had, coronary heart disease, heart failure, diabetes, breathing problems, an overactive thyroid gland or liver, or kidney disease. It is not known if this medicine will harm an unborn baby but tell your doctor if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Iobet Eye Drop should not be used if you are breastfeeding.",

484,Esomeprazole Tablets IP 40 mg,10's,20.9,Gastrointestinal (GIT),1005,Esoprazole 40mg Tablet,"Esoprazole 40mg Tablet is used to treat conditions related to excessive stomach acid production, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It reduces the amount of acid produced in the stomach and provides relief from symptoms and promotes healing.

Esoprazole 40mg Tablet can also be used to prevent stomach ulcers caused by certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Take the medicine as per your doctor's prescription. The dose will depend on what you are being treated for, but it is usually the lowest dose for the shortest time that is needed to treat your condition. It is usually taken on an empty stomach, preferably in the morning or at least 1 hour prior to meal. Continue taking the medicine even if your symptoms disappear until the doctor say it is okay to stop. If you are taking this medicine for a long time, your doctor may carry out regular tests to check your levels of magnesium which can fall with this medicine.

Common side effects include headache, constipation or diarrhea, stomach pain, and feeling or being sick. These tend to be mild but talk to your doctor if they bother you or do not go away. The risk of side effects may increase the longer you take this medicine. You may be more likely to have a broken bone if you take it for a long time. It is best to avoid foods that seem to make your symptoms worse, such as rich, spicy, and fatty foods. Cutting down on caffeinated drinks, such as tea, coffee, and cola, as well as alcohol may also help.

This medicine is not suitable for some people. Before taking this medicine, you need to tell your doctor if you have severe liver problems, are taking medicines for HIV, have had an allergic reaction to similar medicines in the past, or have osteoporosis. Alcohol does not interfere with the way Esoprazole 40mg Tablet works. However, drinking alcohol makes your stomach produce more acid than normal. This medicine can make you feel dizzy, sleepy, or affect your vision. If this happens, do not drive, cycle, or use machinery or tools until you feel better. It is not usually recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding.",74.0

Never give more than the recommended dose for fast relief as that may cause unwanted effects in your child.

Your child may exhibit side effects like nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, heartburn, and diarrhea after taking this medicine.

889,Febuxostat Tablets 80mg,10's,34,Ortho,1295,Febustat 80 Tablet,"Febustat 80 Tablet is a medicine used to treat and prevent gout. Gout happens when there is too much uric acid in your body and it forms into crystals that can appear around your joints leading to painful and swollen joints. This medicine helps to keep uric acid levels low.

Febustat 80 Tablet can be taken with or without food. You should keep taking it as recommended by your doctor even when you are not having a gout attack. If you stop, your symptoms may get worse because of the formation of more crystals in your joints. You can help yourself by making some changes to your diet (eg. avoiding alcohol and non-vegetarian foods) and drinking plenty of fluids.

Some of the common side effects of this medicine are headache, diarrhea, nausea, and skin rash. You may experience a temporary increase in the gout symptoms (rapid onset of severe pain, warmth, and redness in the joint) when you first start taking the medicine. However, do not stop taking the medicine. Your doctor may suggest some painkillers and additional medicines to help reduce or prevent these symptoms. Tell your doctor right away if you get any symptoms of liver disease like persistent nausea, dark urine, or yellowing of the eyes or skin.

Before taking this medicine, let your doctor know if you have any heart problems, stroke, thyroid problems, or kidney or liver problems. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, this medicine is best avoided. Check with your doctor. You will need regular blood tests while taking this medicine to check that your liver is working properly.",
935,Letrozole Tablets IP 2.5mg,10's,34,Oncology,1296,Letroz Tablet,"Letroz Tablet helps treat breast cancer in post-menopausal women. It may be used alone or with other treatments, such as surgery or radiation. It can also be used in patients with advanced breast cancer to stop the tumor from spreading to other parts of the body.

Letroz Tablet is also helpful in the treatment of infertility. It can be taken with or without food, but take it at about the same time to get the most benefit. The dose and frequency depend on what you are taking it for. Your doctor will decide how much you need to improve your symptoms. You should take this medicine for as long as it is prescribed.

This medicine's most common side effects include hot flashes, fatigue, increased sweating, increased level of cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), bone and joint pain, dizziness, edema, and flushing. If these bother you or appear serious, let your doctor know. Your doctor may suggest ways to prevent or reduce these.

Before taking this medicine, tell your doctor if you have ever had liver or kidney disease, or have a history of osteoporosis (thinning or wasting of bones).  Your doctor should also know about all other medicines you are taking as many of these may make this medicine less effective or change the way it works. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Your doctor may perform some blood tests to check for vitamin D level or bone density before and during treatment.",

2124,Nitroglycerin Controlled Release Tablets 6.4 mg,30's in Bottle,55,Cardiovascular System (CVS),1573,Nitrocontin 6.4 Tablet CR,"Nitrocontin 6.4 Tablet CR is used to treat and prevent heart-related chest pain (angina). Angina occurs when the heart muscle is not getting enough blood. This medicine works by relaxing and widening blood vessels so blood can flow more easily to the heart.
Nitrocontin 6.4 Tablet CR should be taken in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor. It may be taken with or without food, preferably at a fixed time each day. Do not consume more than the recommended dose, as this may have harmful effects on your body. You can develop tolerance to this medicine over time, which means that the same dose becomes less effective. You have to stick to a really specific dosing schedule to prevent this from happening.
The most common side effect of this medicine is a headache which may be severe. This can sometimes be helped by drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding alcohol. You may also experience lightheadedness, which could increase your risk of having a fall. There are other, rarer side effects, some of them serious. Ask your doctor and read the leaflet which comes with the medicine to make sure you are keeping safe.
Do not use this medicine if you are taking medicines to treat high blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension), erectile dysfunction or if you have anemia or glaucoma (increased pressure inside the eye). Always tell your doctor what other health conditions you have and what other medicines you are taking. It is best not to drink alcohol with this medicine as it increases some of the side effects. If you are affected by dizziness, avoid driving. If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding, ask your doctor before taking this medicine.",

It blocks and reduces the release of certain chemicals in the eye that cause pain and swelling. This makes the healing process after eye surgery more comfortable and helps the eye heal faster.
Always wash your hands before using Nevanac Ophthalmic Suspension. Use only the number of drops that your doctor has prescribed and wait for about five minutes between each drop. If you wear contact lenses, remove them before using the drops and wait for at least 15 minutes before putting them back in. You should not touch the tip of the dropper or bottle. This may lead to infection.
Use of the medicine may cause decreased vision, foreign body sensation in the eyes, and increased intraocular pressure. These are usually temporary and resolve with time. However, if they persist or get worse, you should let your doctor know. Your doctor may be able to suggest ways of preventing or reducing the symptoms.
Before using this medicine, you should tell your doctor about all the other medicines you are taking. You should also tell your doctor if you have any other medical conditions or disorders. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult with their doctors before using the medicine.",

Angina occurs when the heart muscle is not getting enough blood. This medicine works by relaxing and widening blood vessels so blood can flow more easily to the heart.
New GTN 2.6 Tablet CR should be taken in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor. It may be taken with or without food, preferably at a fixed time each day. Do not consume more than the recommended dose, as this may have harmful effects on your body. You can develop tolerance to this medicine over time, which means that the same dose becomes less effective. You have to stick to a really specific dosing schedule to prevent this from happening.
The most common side effect of this medicine is a headache which may be severe. This can sometimes be helped by drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding alcohol. You may also experience lightheadedness, which could increase your risk of having a fall. There are other, rarer side effects, some of them serious. Ask your doctor and read the leaflet which comes with the medicine to make sure you are keeping safe.
Do not use this medicine if you are taking medicines to treat high blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension), erectile dysfunction or if you have anemia or glaucoma (increased pressure inside the eye). Always tell your doctor what other health conditions you have and what other medicines you are taking. It is best not to drink alcohol with this medicine as it increases some of the side effects. If you are affected by dizziness, avoid driving. If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding, ask your doctor before taking this medicine.",175.0

The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, respiratory tract infection, fungal infections in the mouth, headache, hoarseness of voice, sore throat, cough, musculoskeletal (bone, muscle, or joint) pain, and increased heart rate. If you get there, do not stop taking it but do talk to your doctor.
